# TouchCalculator

A porting and further development of the ESP32 Calculator TTGO T-Display Board project by VolosR for the Sunton Board ESP32-2432S028R (ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display Board â€“ CYD) using and adapting the button library TFT_eSPI_Button by bodmer.

> [!NOTE]
> To make the display functional, the file User_Setup.h in the directory .pio/libdebs/esp32-2432S08Rv3/TFT_eSpi must be replaced with the file User_Setup.h from the include directory.
